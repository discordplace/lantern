## WebSocket

The WebSocket connection is available at `wss://lantern.rest/socket`.

Once connected, you will receive `Opcode 1: Hello` which will contain `heartbeat_interval` in the data field.

You should set a repeating interval for the time specified in `heartbeat_interval` which should send Opcode 4: Heartbeat on the interval.

You should send `Opcode 2: Initialize` immediately after receiving `Opcode 1: Hello` with the following payload:

<details>
  <summary>
    Subscribe to User
  </summary>
  
  ```json
  {
    "op": 2,
    "d": {
      "user_id": "123456789012345678"
    }
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Subscribe to Multiple Users
  </summary>

  ```json
  {
    "op": 2,
    "d": {
      "user_ids": ["123456789012345678", "234567890123456789"]
    }
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Subscribe to All Users
  </summary>

  ```json
  {
    "op": 2,
    "d": {
      "user_ids": ["All"]
    }
  }
  ```
</details>
<br/>

You will receive `Opcode 3: Initialize Acknowledgement` once the server has acknowledged your subscription and this will contain the all data for the user(s) you have subscribed to in the `d` field.

If any user you have subscribed to updates their presence, you will receive `Opcode 6: Presence Update` with the updated data in the `d` field.

If any user you have subscribed leaves the Lantern server, you will receive `Opcode 7: User Left` with the user ID in the `d` field. (when subscribing to multiple users, you will receive this for each user that leaves, if no users are left, you will receive `Opcode 9: Disconnect`)

##### List of Opcodes
| Opcode | Description | Type |
| ------ | ----------- | ---- |
| 1 | HELLO | Server -> Client |
| 2 | INIT | Client -> Server |
| 3 | INIT_ACK | Server -> Client |

| 5 | HEARTBEAT_ACK | Server -> Client |
| 6 | PRESENCE_UPDATE | Server -> Client |

## Self-Hosting

To self-host Lantern, you will need to have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (usually comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

Once you have the prerequisites installed, follow these steps to self-host Lantern:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone
```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd lantern/server
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following environment variables:

```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri

# For GitHub Auto Deploy (not needed for local development)
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_github_webhook_secret
```

5. Fill these configuration values in the `config.toml` file with your own values:

```toml
base_guild_id = '1253092552404631582'

[server]
port = 3003
```

6. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

7. The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3003`. You can access the API and WebSocket connection from this URL.

> [!NOTE]  
> __**Make sure you enable**__ these settings in your bot's application settings:
> - `PRESENCE INTENT`
> - `GUILD MEMBERS INTENT`
